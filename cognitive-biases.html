</ul>

<h2>Belief & interpretation biases</h2>
<ul>

  <li>Anchoring — relying heavily on the first piece of information encountered</li>
  <li>Framing effect — decisions shifting when the same information is worded differently</li>
  <li>Halo effect — positive impressions coloring unrelated judgments</li>
