<h1>The Evidence on Open Plan Offices/h1>

<p>
A concise list of research findings on how open-plan offices undermine focus, health, and collaboration.
</p>

<h2>Harvard Business School – Bernstein &amp; Turban (2018)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Face-to-face interaction dropped sharply after shift to open-plan</li>
  <li>Email and instant messaging increased instead of real-world collaboration</li>
  <li>Workers withdrew socially to protect privacy and concentration</li>
</ul>

<h2>Experimental Research on Office Noise &amp; Cognition</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Background speech impairs working memory</li>
  <li>Reduces reading comprehension and information retention</li>
  <li>Slows problem-solving and complex thinking</li>
  <li>Increases mental fatigue over the workday</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steelcase / Ipsos Global Study (2014)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Large share of workers report inability to concentrate in open offices</li>
  <li>High dissatisfaction with noise and lack of privacy</li>
  <li>Around 86 minutes per day lost to distractions and interruptions</li>
  <li>Many rely on headphones as a coping mechanism rather than a preference</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment &amp; Health – Pejtersen et al. (2011)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Shared and open-plan offices linked to more sick days than private offices</li>
  <li>Higher sickness absence in large open rooms with many occupants</li>
  <li>Greater opportunity for viral spread and stress-related absence</li>
</ul>

<h2>Journal of Environmental Psychology – Kim &amp; de Dear (2013)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Open-plan offices had the lowest satisfaction of all layouts studied</li>
  <li>Private offices clearly outperformed open-plan on acoustics and privacy</li>
  <li>Loss of privacy was the strongest driver of dissatisfaction</li>
  <li>Frequent interruptions and crowding complaints in open plans</li>
</ul>

<h2>Research on Stress &amp; Open-Plan Noise</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Open-office noise linked to elevated stress responses</li>
  <li>Workers report higher fatigue and emotional exhaustion</li>
  <li>Conflicts and irritation increase with constant proximity and noise</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cal Newport – <em>Deep Work</em> (2016)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Deep, focused work is crucial for high-value knowledge tasks</li>
  <li>Frequent interruptions create “attention residue” that degrades performance</li>
  <li>Open offices structurally encourage shallow, reactive work instead of deep work</li>
</ul>

<h2>Short description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  Across multiple fields, empirical research finds that open-plan offices reduce focus and satisfaction,
  increase stress and sick days, and fail to deliver the promised gains in collaboration.
