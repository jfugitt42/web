  { front: "If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,",

  { front: "If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,", 
    back:  "Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies," },

  { front: "Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,", 
    back:  "And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;" },


  // ——— Stanza 2 ———

  { front: "If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;", 
    back:  "If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;" },

  { front: "If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster", 
    back:  "And treat those two impostors just the same;" },

  { front: "If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken", 
    back:  "Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools," },

  { front: "Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,", 
    back:  "And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools;" },


  // ——— Stanza 3 ———

  { front: "If you can make one heap of all your winnings", 
    back:  "And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss," },

  { front: "And lose, and start again at your beginnings", 
    back:  "And never breathe a word about your loss;" },

  { front: "If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew", 
    back:  "To serve your turn long after they are gone," },

  { front: "And so hold on when there is nothing in you", 
    back:  "Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’" },


  // ——— Stanza 4 ———

  { front: "If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,", 
    back:  "Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch," },

  { front: "If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,", 
    back:  "If all men count with you, but none too much;" },

  { front: "If you can fill the unforgiving minute", 
    back:  "With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run," },

  { front: "Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,", 
    back:  "And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!" }
