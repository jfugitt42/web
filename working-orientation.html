  <p>
    These notes help me show up more reliably in life, especially when things get messy.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m aiming less for “confidence” and more for availability, staying present, responding honestly, and repairing quickly along the journey.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stay closer to what’s happening than to the story about it.</strong> <em>Attention over narration.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Act without requiring comfort, certainty, or approval.</strong> <em>Recoverability matters more than confidence.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Be useful where possible; don’t disappear to be helpful.</strong> <em>Contribution without erasure.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Speak what’s true enough for the moment.</strong> <em>Clarity over performance.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Trust myself to respond and repair.</strong> <em>No pre-negotiation with fear.</em></li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Re-read when stuck. Ignore when things are flowing.</em></p>
