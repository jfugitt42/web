      <p>
        These notes help me show up consistently and responsively in life,
        especially when situations feel unclear or uncomfortable.
      </p>

      <p>
        They are not ideals or promises. I keep them as functional reminders for
        action when my attention drifts toward self-evaluation instead of what’s
        actually needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m aiming less for “confidence” and more for availability — staying
        present, responding honestly, and repairing quickly when needed.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Stay closer to what’s happening than to the story about it.</strong>
          <em>Attention over narration.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Act without requiring comfort, certainty, or approval.</strong>
          <em>Recoverability matters more than confidence.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be useful where possible; don’t disappear to be helpful.</strong>
          <em>Contribution without erasure.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Speak what’s true enough for the moment.</strong>
          <em>Clarity over performance.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Trust myself to respond and repair.</strong>
          <em>No pre-negotiation with fear.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I tend to return to this when I feel reactive, overly self-conscious,
        or stuck in narrative rather than response.
      </p>

      <p><em>Re-read when stuck. Ignore when things are flowing.</em></p>
