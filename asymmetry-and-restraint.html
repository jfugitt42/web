## Asymmetry, Maturity, and First Contact

Human history shows that contact between societies at different stages of development often goes badly. This is not because difference itself is dangerous, but because power is easy to misuse. A mature civilization is defined less by what it can do than by how it behaves under asymmetry.

The following principles apply to encounters between unequal societies, cultures, or intelligences—whether less developed, more developed, or unknown.

- **Societies grow at different speeds.**  
  Differences in development are normal and inevitable, not moral judgments.

- **Power creates responsibility, not entitlement.**  
  Greater capability increases the obligation to exercise restraint.

- **Civilization is demonstrated by restraint.**  
  What matters most is not what can be done, but what is deliberately not done.

- **Fairness is not sameness.**  
  Equality is not required for dignity; humiliation is never justified.

- **Contact should not outrun understanding.**  
  Rapid intervention, forced assistance, or imposed solutions often cause lasting harm.

- **Learning cannot be outsourced.**  
  Growth must occur internally; shortcuts undermine long-term stability and autonomy.

- **First contact tests the powerful more than the vulnerable.**  
  Asymmetry reveals character, not superiority.

- **Treat less developed groups as you would hope to be treated by more developed ones.**  
  This standard applies in both directions and across time.

- **Legacy matters.**  
  Civilizations are judged less by their achievements than by how they wielded power over others.

- **Readiness is behavioral, not technological.**  
  The ability to coexist responsibly matters more than intelligence or advancement.

If we want to be treated with dignity when we are outmatched, we must practice giving dignity when we are not.
