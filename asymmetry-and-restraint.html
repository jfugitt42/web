<h2>Asymmetry and Restraint</h2>
<p><em>How civilizations should behave when power is unequal</em></p>

<p>
Human history shows that contact between societies at different stages of development often goes badly.
This is not because difference itself is dangerous, but because power is easy to misuse.
A mature civilization is defined less by what it can do than by how it behaves under asymmetry.
</p>

<p>
The following principles apply to encounters between unequal societies, cultures, or intelligences—whether
less developed, more developed, or unknown.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Societies grow at different speeds.</strong><br>
  Differences in development are normal and inevitable, not moral judgments.</li>

  <li><strong>Power creates responsibility, not entitlement.</strong><br>
  Greater capability increases the obligation to exercise restraint.</li>

  <li><strong>Civilization is demonstrated by restraint.</strong><br>
  What matters most is not what can be done, but what is deliberately not done.</li>

  <li><strong>Fairness is not sameness.</strong><br>
  Equality is not required for dignity; humiliation is never justified.</li>

  <li><strong>Contact should not outrun understanding.</strong><br>
  Rapid intervention, forced assistance, or imposed solutions often cause lasting harm.</li>

  <li><strong>Learning cannot be outsourced.</strong><br>
  Growth must occur internally; shortcuts undermine long-term stability and autonomy.</li>

  <li><strong>First contact tests the powerful more than the vulnerable.</strong><br>
  Asymmetry reveals character, not superiority.</li>

  <li><strong>Treat less developed groups as you would hope to be treated by more developed ones.</strong><br>
  This standard applies in both directions and across time.</li>

  <li><strong>Legacy matters.</strong><br>
  Civilizations are judged less by their achievements than by how they wielded power over others.</li>

  <li><strong>Readiness is behavioral, not technological.</strong><br>
  The ability to coexist responsibly matters more than intelligence or advancement.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If we want to be treated with dignity when we are outmatched,
we must practice giving dignity when we are not.

<h3>FAQ & Counterarguments</h3>

<p>
This section addresses common questions and objections to the framework above.
The goal is clarification, not persuasion.
</p>

<h4>Isn’t this just moral idealism?</h4>
<p>
No. The framework is based on historical patterns, not optimism.
Most failures of first contact were not due to bad intentions,
but to unmanaged asymmetry and lack of restraint.
</p>

<h4>Doesn’t this assume one group gets to decide what “mature” means?</h4>
<p>
The standard is behavioral, not cultural.
Restraint, consent, and non-humiliation can be evaluated without imposing values,
beliefs, or lifestyles.
</p>

<h4>What if restraint allows harm to continue?</h4>
<p>
Restraint is not inaction.
It means proportional, reversible, and consent-based engagement
rather than coercion or domination.
</p>

<h4>Haven’t unequal encounters always gone badly?</h4>
<p>
They have gone badly when power was treated as entitlement.
The framework exists precisely because history shows what happens without it.
</p>

<h4>Isn’t this just a softer form of paternalism?</h4>
<p>
Paternalism assumes outsiders know best and should decide outcomes.
This framework limits outsider authority and prioritizes internal growth and autonomy.
</p>

<h4>What about cases where intervention clearly saves lives?</h4>
<p>
Emergency aid is compatible with restraint.
The distinction is between assistance that preserves agency
and intervention that replaces it.
</p>

<h4>Does this deny real differences in capability or development?</h4>
<p>
No. Differences are acknowledged explicitly.
The claim is that difference does not justify erasure, humiliation,
or forced compliance.
</p>

<h4>How does this apply when we are the less developed group?</h4>
<p>
The same standards apply in reverse.
Dignity under asymmetry is the minimum expectation for any claim of civilization.
</p>

<h4>Is this framework enforceable?</h4>
<p>
No framework guarantees good outcomes.
This one provides a consistent standard for evaluating behavior
before, during, and after asymmetric encounters.
</p>

<h4>What if others don’t follow these rules?</h4>
<p>
That risk always exists.
The framework is about how we choose to behave,
not about controlling others.
</p>

<p>
These principles are not about guaranteeing success.
They are about minimizing predictable failure when power is uneven.
