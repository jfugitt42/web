<h1>Possibilianism</h1>

<p>
  Possibilianism is a philosophical stance proposed by neuroscientist David Eagleman.
  It emphasizes radical open-mindedness and humility in the face of unknowns,
  especially about God, consciousness, and the universe.
</p>

<h2>Core Principles</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Refusal to claim certainty where evidence is thin or absent</li>
  <li>Openness to multiple, competing explanations at once</li>
  <li>Preference for “many live hypotheses” over a single fixed belief</li>
  <li>Commitment to updating views as new data arrive</li>
  <li>Dislike of dogmatism, whether religious or aggressively atheistic</li>
</ul>

<h2>View of God & Metaphysics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Does not assert that God exists</li>
  <li>Does not assert that God does not exist</li>
  <li>Holds that our current knowledge is too limited for confident claims</li>
  <li>Treats “something beyond the observable universe” as an open question</li>
  <li>Encourages imaginative but disciplined speculation about ultimate reality</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relation to Other Positions</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Versus atheism:</strong> less confident that “there is no God”</li>
  <li><strong>Versus theism:</strong> refuses to endorse specific doctrines</li>
  <li><strong>Versus agnosticism:</strong> more focused on active exploration than on mere “not knowing”</li>
  <li><strong>Versus skepticism:</strong> skeptical of certainty, not of possibility itself</li>
</ul>

<h2>Epistemic Attitude (How It Treats Knowledge)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Assumes our models of reality are provisional and incomplete</li>
  <li>Separates “currently unsupported” from “impossible”</li>
  <li>Values empirical science as the best tool we have, but not the last word</li>
  <li>Encourages mapping possible explanations, then testing them where we can</li>
</ul>

<h2>Practical Implications</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comfortable saying “I don’t know” about big existential questions</li>
  <li>Avoids building identity around absolute metaphysical claims</li>
  <li>Promotes curiosity-driven research into consciousness and cosmology</li>
  <li>Supports humility in debates over religion, spirituality, and science</li>
  <li>Leaves room for awe and wonder without committing to dogma</li>
</ul>

<h2>Critiques & Challenges</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Some see it as “atheism with softer branding”</li>
  <li>Others see it as too vague to guide concrete belief or practice</li>
  <li>Hard to define clear boundaries between healthy openness and credulity</li>
  <li>Raises questions about how to live ethically amid deep uncertainty</li>
</ul>
