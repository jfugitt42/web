<h1>Civilization Roadmap</h1>

<p>A staged roadmap for a humane, stable, and net-positive future: meeting basic needs, fixing incentives, reducing systemic risks, and building long-term resilience.</p>

<h2>Core idea</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Begin with keystone actions that unlock many benefits at once</li>
  <li>Meet basic needs early so cooperation and innovation become easier</li>
  <li>Flip incentives so long-term value outcompetes short-term damage</li>
  <li>Prefer interventions with strong multipliers and durable effects</li>
  <li>Upgrade institutions so they can learn and adapt as quickly as technology</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guiding principles</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Meet basic needs first: food, water, health, safety, education</li>
  <li>Price harms and reward positives instead of relying solely on goodwill</li>
  <li>Back policies with evidence where available; use best-guess models where not</li>
  <li>Invest once in durable infrastructure instead of endless short-term patches</li>
  <li>Use transparent, digital, and auditable systems to support trust</li>
</ul>

<h2>Phase 1 · Years 0–5 — Stabilise and boost demand at the bottom</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Close the hunger and extreme-poverty gap globally</li>
  <li>Scale low-cost digital cash-transfer systems so every adult can receive direct aid or wages</li>
  <li>Provide universal school meals and micronutrient fortification in low- and middle-income countries</li>
  <li>Fund R&amp;D in deep-geothermal power, long-duration energy storage, and water-from-air technologies</li>
  <li>Introduce rising prices on carbon, single-use plastics, and planned-obsolescence waste</li>
</ul>

<h3>Phase 1 milestones</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Child hunger and stunting sharply reduced</li>
  <li>First 24/7 deep-geothermal demonstration plants online</li>
  <li>Carbon and plastic fees generating stable revenues for social and green investments</li>
</ul>

<h2>Phase 2 · Years 6–15 — Re-structure for long-term value</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Shift capital-gains and corporate-tax rules to reward long-term holdings and impact reporting</li>
  <li>Make early-childhood education and parental support universal</li>
  <li>Transform justice systems from punishment-first to rehabilitation-first</li>
  <li>Rebuild curricula around critical thinking, media literacy, empathy, and civic competence</li>
  <li>Build digital public infrastructure (ID, payments, data trusts) on open standards</li>
</ul>

<h3>Phase 2 milestones</h3>
<ul>
  <li>High school completion rates above 90% in most countries</li>
  <li>Recidivism reduced through education, mental health care, and rehabilitation</li>
  <li>Digital tools widely used in budgeting and public decision-making</li>
</ul>

<h2>Phase 3 · Year 16 onward — Establish resilience</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Reach net-negative carbon and a circular materials economy</li>
  <li>Redirect excess military growth into global risk reduction through “peace dividend” mechanisms</li>
  <li>Create lifelong-learning and civic-income systems funded by sovereign wealth and long-run returns</li>
</ul>

<h3>Phase 3 milestones</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Atmospheric CO₂ levels falling each year</li>
  <li>Majority of materials circulating in closed loops</li>
  <li>Dedicated global funds for pandemics, AI risk, climate adaptation, and planetary defense</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why the package matters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Keystone actions are interdependent; removing one weakens the whole structure</li>
  <li>Social protection supports climate policy and technological transition</li>
  <li>Clean energy and smart taxes help finance education and justice reform</li>
  <li>Education and health improvements accelerate innovation and governance capacity</li>
  <li>Together they create a reinforcing loop rather than fragile, isolated fixes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Second-stage boosters (Years 0–10, overlapping)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Superbug Defense Fund — payments for new antibiotics and rapid diagnostics to counter antimicrobial resistance</li>
  <li>100-Day Vaccine Mission — capacity to design, test, and scale vaccines for new pathogens within ~100 days</li>
  <li>Vector-control and gene-drive programs targeting major disease carriers</li>
  <li>Mental-health and loneliness infrastructure: community spaces, digital peer support, social prescribing</li>
  <li>Alt-protein cost-parity sprint — funding to bring low-emission proteins to price parity with conventional meat</li>
  <li>Regenerative-agriculture carbon markets — payments for verified soil-carbon gains and resilience improvements</li>
  <li>Governance-as-code systems — citizens’ assemblies and advanced voting tools on secure digital rails</li>
  <li>Compute-governance treaties — registration and licensing of advanced AI compute to cap unsafe capability races</li>
</ul>

<h2>Planetary-boundary and risk extensions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cut methane emissions rapidly, especially from fossil-fuel leaks and agriculture</li>
  <li>Decarbonise cement and construction through new materials and updated standards</li>
  <li>Scale permanent carbon storage in minerals, ecosystems, and engineered systems</li>
  <li>Protect and reconnect biodiversity through land and ocean conservation corridors</li>
  <li>Provide universal digital public infrastructure and broadband access</li>
  <li>Build global multi-hazard early-warning and response systems</li>
  <li>Govern extraction of key materials (such as sand) and phase out dangerous chemicals</li>
  <li>Create institutions representing future generations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Long-term extension: beyond Earth</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Stabilise Earth and build deep-tech capacity as the launchpad</li>
  <li>Develop a commercial cis-lunar economy and space infrastructure</li>
  <li>Scale life-support, planetary-defense, and space-habitat technologies</li>
  <li>Pursue off-world expansion only after Earth is resilient</li>
</ul>

<h2>Meta-principles</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Prefer interventions with high long-term multipliers</li>
  <li>Reduce catastrophic and existential risks before maximizing growth</li>
  <li>Invest in durable infrastructure over recurring subsidies</li>
  <li>Design systems that remain adaptive under rapid technological change</li>
  <li>Make harmful externalities visible and priced</li>
  <li>Align incentives with long-term value creation</li>
  <li>Strengthen human capabilities early: health, nutrition, learning</li>
  <li>Preserve optionality; avoid irreversible decisions under uncertainty</li>
  <li>Use transparency and data to support trust and cooperation</li>
  <li>Build globally interoperable systems whenever possible</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design constraints</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Reduce existential and global catastrophic risk</li>
  <li>Stay within planetary ecological limits</li>
  <li>Avoid single points of failure in energy, supply, governance, and compute</li>
  <li>Ensure benefits reach the poorest and least represented</li>
  <li>Preserve democratic values and human rights</li>
  <li>Enable distributed resilience, not centralized fragility</li>
  <li>Engineer for both robustness and graceful failure modes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Short version</h2>
<ul>
  <li>End hunger and extreme poverty</li>
  <li>Universal childhood nutrition and early education</li>
  <li>Direct cash systems and basic social protection</li>
  <li>Massive clean-energy and water innovation</li>
  <li>Price pollution and waste; reward long-term value</li>
  <li>Rehabilitative justice and mental-health support</li>
  <li>Critical thinking, media literacy, and civic education</li>
  <li>Digital public infrastructure and transparent governance</li>
  <li>Net-negative carbon and circular materials</li>
  <li>Global systems for pandemics, AI risk, and biosecurity</li>
  <li>Biodiversity protection and continental-scale wildlife corridors</li>
  <li>Space and off-world expansion after Earth is stable</li>
</ul>

<h2>What this builds toward</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A stable world where basic needs are met</li>
  <li>A global economy aligned with long-term value</li>
  <li>Reduced existential and catastrophic risk</li>
  <li>Institutions capable of learning and adapting</li>
  <li>Healthy, educated, cooperative populations</li>
  <li>A resilient civilization capable of exploring beyond Earth</li>
</ul>
